# Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## Overview
The **Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition** is an automated attendance management system designed to streamline the process of marking student attendance in schools, colleges, and institutes. By leveraging **OpenCV** and Python’s built-in functionalities, this system eliminates manual errors, saves time, and prevents proxy attendance by employing facial recognition technology.

### Features
- Automated student attendance marking.
- Face identification for secure and accurate attendance.
- Prevents proxy attendance through facial authorization.
- Records attendance data and stores it in an Excel file for easy access and analysis.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions face challenges in maintaining accurate attendance records due to outdated methods like:
1. Roll call attendance.
2. Manual signature sheets.

These methods are time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to manipulation. Hence, there is a need for an automated system to address these shortcomings.

## Proposed System
The proposed system uses facial recognition technology to automate the attendance process. The main advantages include:
- Faster and more efficient attendance recording.
- Enhanced accuracy and reliability.
- Reduction in human intervention, thus eliminating manual errors.

## How to Run the System
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pandas numpy
   ```
2. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the Python script to start the attendance system.
   ```bash
   python attendance_system.py
   ```
3. **Collect Attendance Data**:
   - The system will detect faces in real-time.
   - Upon recognizing a face, it will record the student’s attendance.

4. **Export Attendance**:
   Attendance will be saved automatically in an Excel file with the following format:
   | Enrollment Number | Date       | Time       |
   |-------------------|------------|------------|
   | 12345            | 2025-01-28 | 09:00:00   |
